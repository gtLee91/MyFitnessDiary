# My Fitness Diary project
## Introduction
Nowadays, many people's interests are shifting to health and exercise. So People want to record in detail document the type and duration of their exercise.
Moreover, many people want to know, record, and manage what foods they eat and how many calories are in those foods as part of their desire for healthy weight loss. 
These things already exist in notebooks, such as fitness logs, workout schedules, and dietary management. 
But as mentioned earlier, if people manage and record in the form of an application on a mobile device that they always carry around, they will be able to use it quickly and conveniently. 
For this reason, we thought people should develop an application with both functions instead of downloading and using two applications for different functions or writing directly using a notebook.
